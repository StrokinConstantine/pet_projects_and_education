programming = building pyramid of abstractions
A model of computation = is a set of basic operations ( building blocks ) and their respective costs ( as integers )
Most models of computation are also abstract machines ( = hypothetical computer, like the Turing machine, Church's lambda calculus ), whose instructions correspond to the modelâ€™s basic operations.
Computer architecture is high level description, compared to the lowest level description of CM.

von Neumann architecture
CPU <-> COMMON BUS <-> MEM
CPU = CU + ALU, CU fetches instructions from memory
features:
	* memory stores only bits;
	* memory stores code and data, they have no differences in memory, both are bit strings;
	* memory is organized into cells with addresses ( modern computers take 1 byte as 1 memory cell );
	* execution of program instructions sequential unless jump instruction.
	
Assembly language for a chosen prosessor is a PL consisting of mnemonics for each binary encoded instruction ( machine code ).
An architecture does not always define a precise instruction set, unlike a CM.
Memory state and registers state fully describe CPU state. Instructions = effects on memory and registers.

Intel 64 architecture = x86_64 = AMD64
Processors can operate in a number of modes: real mode, protected, victual, long, etc.
Intel 64 architecture extensions of von Neumann's architecture:
	* registers = memory cells placed directly on CPU chip. Register accesses do not use the bus. The response time is quite small;
	* hardware stack. Implements abstraction of stack on top of memory;
	* interrupts. Allows one to change program execution order based on events external to the program itself ( some registers are saved );
	* protection rings. A CPU is always in a state corresponding to one of the protection rings. Each ring defines a set of allowed instructions. Zero-th ring allows executing any instruction from CPU's instruction set.
	* virtual memory. An abstraction over physical memory. It helps to isolate program and to distribute memory between programs in a safer and more effective way.
Some extensions are not directly accessible by a programmer ( e.g., caches or shadow registers ).
Do not use search engines for instruction descriptions.
Most of the time the working set of memory cells should be small enough, so CPU can work with registers.

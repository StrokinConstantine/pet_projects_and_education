programming = building pyramid of abstractions
A model of computation = is a set of basic operations ( building blocks ) and their respective costs ( as integers )
Most models of computation are also abstract machines ( = hypothetical computer, like the Turing machine, Church's lambda calculus ), whose instructions correspond to the modelâ€™s basic operations.
Computer architecture is high level description, compared to the lowest level description of CM.

von Neumann architecture
CPU <-> COMMON BUS <-> MEM
CPU = CU + ALU, CU fetches instructions from memory
features:
	* memory stores only bits;
	* memory stores code and data, they have no differences in memory, both are bit strings;
	* memory is organized into cells with addresses ( modern computers take 1 byte as 1 memory cell );
	* execution of program instructions sequential unless jump instruction;
	
Assembly language for a chosen prosessor is a PL consisting of mnemonics for each binary encoded instruction ( machine code ).
An architecture does not always define a precise instruction set, unlike a CM.
Memory state and registers state fully describe CPU state. Instructions = effects on memory and registers.

Intel 64 architecture = x86_64 = AMD64
Processors can operate in a number of modes: real mode, protected, victual, long, etc.
